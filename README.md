A lightweight EventSource (server-sent-events) hook for react, written in TypeScript.

#### Why use this hook?

- Very lightweight (see the badges above for the latest size).
- Flexible and dead simple to use.
- Written in TypeScript
- Only has one required peer dependency: React 16.8.6 or higher.
- Optional peer dependencies (if you use redux): redux 4 and react-redux > 7.1.0
- Liberal license: [zlib/libpng](https://github.com/Lusito/react-use-event-source-ts/blob/master/LICENSE)

**Beware**: This is currently work in progress. The API might change.

### Installation via NPM

```npm i react-use-event-source-ts```

This library is shipped as es2015 modules. To use them in browsers, you'll have to transpile them using webpack or similar, which you probably already do.

### Examples

#### Plain React

```tsx
import { useEventSource, useEventSourceListener } from "../../rest/useEventSource";

function MyComponent() {
    const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Message[]>([]);
    
    const [eventSource, eventSourceStatus] = useEventSource("api/events", true);
    useEventSourceListener(eventSource, ['update'], evt => {
        setMessages([
            ...messages,
            ...JSON.parse(evt.data)
        ]);
    }, [messages]);

    return (
        <div>
            {eventSourceStatus === "open" ? null : <BusyIndicator />}
            {messages.map((msg) => <div>{msg.text}</div>)}
        </div>
    );
}
```

#### With redux

```tsx
import { useEventSource, useEventSourceListenerRedux, EventSourceEvent } from "../../rest/useEventSource";

function eventHandler(store: Store<State, Action>, e: EventSourceEvent) {
    store.dispatch(addMessages(JSON.parse(e.data)));
}

function MyComponent() {
    const messages = useSelector(getMessages);
    const [eventSource, eventSourceStatus] = useEventSource("api/events", true);
    useEventSourceListenerRedux(eventSource, ['update'], eventHandler);

    return (
        <div>
            {eventSourceStatus === "open" ? null : <BusyIndicator />}
            {messages.map((msg) => <div>{msg.text}</div>)}
        </div>
    );
}
```

### API

```tsx
// Create an EventSource
function useEventSource(
    url: string, // the url to fetch from
    withCredentials?: boolean, // send credentials or not
    ESClass: EventSourceConstructor = EventSource // optionally override the EventSource class (for example with a polyfill)
) => [
    EventSource | null, // the generated EventSource.. on first call, it will be null.
    EventSourceStatus // The status of the connection can be used to display a busy indicator, error indicator, etc.
];

type EventSourceStatus = "init" | "open" | "closed" | "error";

// Add a listener to the EventSource
function useEventSourceListener(
    source: EventSource | null, // The EventSource from the above hook
    types: string[], // the event types to add the listener to
    listener: (e: EventSourceEvent) => void, // a listener callback (use e.type to get the event type)
    dependencies: any[] = [] // if one of the dependencies changes, the listener will be re-added to the event types.
) => void;

// Same as above, but adds a redux store parameter to the listener.
function useEventSourceListenerRedux<S, A extends Action>(
    source: EventSource | null,
    types: string[],
    listener: (store: Store<S, A>, e: EventSourceEvent) => void,
    dependencies: any[] = []
) => void;
```
